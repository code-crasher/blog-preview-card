### What I learned

-Responsive web design,making the card to adopt depending on the user device.
-Making the images responsive by adding a max-width property on them

```
img{
	max-width:100%;
	display:block;
}
``` 

-Css transitions-making the link transition smoothly by adding transition timing function

```
